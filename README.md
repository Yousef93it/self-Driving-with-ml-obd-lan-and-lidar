The development of self-driving platforms is progressing rapidly and continuously, with the potential to
significantly impact various aspects of transportation. These developments could enhance the comfort,
performance, and safety of transportation while reducing human error.
The objective of this project is to construct a self-driving platform using a Raspberry Pi 5 connected
to a camera model Picam 2 and an LiDAR A1M8 from Slamtec. The primary objectives are to
understand the behavior of the LiDAR and develop a collision avoidance functionality based on the
LiDAR. Additionally, the project seeks to integrate this functionality with object detection to create
a robust self-driving platform.
The Raspberry Pi 5 serves as the central processing unit, coordinating inputs from the camera module
and the LiDAR A1M8. The camera module provides real-time visual data for object detection,
while the LiDAR A1M8 enhances the systemâ€™s spatial awareness by delivering accurate distance measurements.
The ultimate goal of this project is to demonstrate a functional prototype with practical
applications in robotics and autonomous systems, highlighting the potential for future advancements
in autonomous vehicle technology.
